    <p><b>Task Content of Work and Mothers' Return to the Labour Market in Germany</b></p>
    <p><u>Abstract:</u> In this paper, I integrate perspectives on gender and employment inequality to present evidence regarding the employment implications of maternity and structural changes in the labor market. To achieve this, I construct measures that capture the task content of occupations using data from the Employment Survey conducted by the German Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB). These indicators illustrate how technology and globalization are influencing the demand for various job activities. The measures are then linked to high-quality individual register data from the German Pension Fund (FDZ-RV) covering the years 2012-2019. Utilizing competing risks models, I discover that women engaged in analytic and interactive occupations, which are in high demand, are the most likely to transition to employment after their first childbirth. Conversely, women with routine occupations susceptible to automation or offshoring are more likely to experience unemployment.</p>

    <p><b>Industrial Robots and Workers’ Well-being in Europe</b></p>
    <p> with <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0672-925X">Daniela Bellani</a> (Università Cattolica di Milano)</p>
    <p><u>Abstract:</u> In this study, we explore the link between industrial robot adoption and workers’ well-being in Europe. To do this, we construct a measure of workers’ exposure to robots on country-industry level by year, using data from International Federation of Robotics and Eurostat. We link that data to pooled 2002-2018 waves of European Social Survey (N = 255.696). Workers’ subjective life satisfaction and happiness are used as measures of well-being. We estimate linear probability models with instrumental variables in order to account for the external shocks which may affect workers’ well-being and robot adoption in parallel. In our analysis, we divide countries into three groups by the level of robot adoption advancement. Additionally, we interact robot adoption with social class. In countries with low adoption of industrial robots, 1 robot per 1000 workers increases the probability of being satisfied with one’s life by 2% in lower middle class and by 3% for small business owners. In contrast, in countries with high adoption of industrial robots, 1 robot per 1000 workers decreases the same probability by 1% in the skilled working class.</p>
