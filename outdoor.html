Requires some navigation -- getting lost in very squeezy clay parts with Radost and four tackle sacks was no fun. Earlier, we'd been also faffing for an hour finding the top entrance. 1h to top entrance + 3h inside, including being taught canyoning-style pull throughs by Brendan and getting lost.</td>

I was the first one prussiking up and the rope was icy -- turns out jammers don't work then and I had to prussik up on prussik knots which was stressful. The approach requires walking on steep terrain beyond trails. We left the hut at 7 AM and came back at 2 AM the next day. Wearing crampons for the hike down was sensible.</td>

The two caves are connected by a man-dig which took us under 1h to go through. Connection requires some routefinding. The entire trip took us 5-6h in total but we were speedy, on a rigging party. Definitely a wetsuit trip. Sliding in Nots II is very nice after crawling through the man-dig. One of my favourite Dales trips so far.</td>
